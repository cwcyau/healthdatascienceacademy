# The National Academy for Health Data Science

## Purpose

The **National Academy for Health Data Science** is a new initiative that seeks to become a nationally accessible training hub in advanced health data science.

It is currently being developed by Professors [Iain Styles](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~ibs/) ([University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk)) and [Christopher Yau](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/christoper-yau) ([Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk)/[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk)) with initial set-up funding from [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk).

## Why are you doing this?

Access to advanced Health Data Science training in the UK is patchy. 

There are concentrations of excellence, particularly around Centres for Doctoral Training, where access to training is restricted to individuals based within certain organisations or even departments within these. There are an increasing variety of training programmes offered both through academic institutions and commercial organisations, but awareness of these training opportunities can be limited, potentially costly and quality assurance maybe lacking. 

Training in certain entry-level topics is highly duplicated (e.g. Introduction to Deep Learning) whilst there is little or no training available in other critical specialist subjects (e.g. Healthcare Requirements Engineering). The lack of scale means financial viability is difficult to achieve for training in certain specialisms. 

Furthermore, for those who are thinking about entering health data science from another discipline, where do you start if you already have considerable expertise and experience in relevant areas? Does someone with a PhD in Theoretical Physics, who can do highly advanced mathematics, need to go back to do a Masters degree in Health Data Science? Can a potential employer afford to invest in the time and cost for someone like this to *“learn on the job”*?

The development of the Academy is a response to all these issues. We want to start connecting the dots of excellence across the UK and support the development of future health data scientists by helping navigate the complex training needs required.

## What will we not do?

The Academy will not support entry-level and introductory training and education in data science. This includes but not exclusively:

-	Mathematical foundations (e.g. linear algebra, numerical analysis),
-	Computer science foundations (e.g. principles of algorithms),
-	Learning programming languages and tools (e.g. how to code in Python),
-	Highly specialised training in subject-specific topics (e.g. bioinformatics analysis using PLINK).

Participants in the Academy will be assumed to have prior experience of these concepts gained from previous studies, work experience or learning through other existing providers (e.g. university-run courses, Coursera).

We do not seek to replicate the many existing training offerings in this domain.

## Who are we looking for?

We expect Academy participants will be someone who has:

1.	Graduate-level experience and capability in core areas of mathematics,
2.	Experience of developing software for scientific research purposes,
3.	The ability to learn new programming languages with relatively little direct guidance.

Participants should also be open-minded and show humility in their approach to learning as they may be introduced to novel concepts or alternate paradigms that conflict with their existing knowledge and practice. 

## What will we do?

The Academy will focus on supporting the following activities:

-	the development of new advanced training courses that fill gaps and unmet needs in health data science,
-	the delivery of training courses that enable disciplinary transitions for scientists with advanced quantitative skills,
-	create and curate accredited learning pathways and curricula to help newcomers to navigate the complex training offerings,
-	providing a specialist forum for employers (academic and commercial) to showcase their research and development activities and attract potential employees.
