# The National Academy for Health Data Science

## Purpose

The **National Academy for Health Data Science** is a new initiative that seeks to become a nationally accessible training hub in advanced health data science.

It is currently being developed by Professors [Iain Styles](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~ibs/) ([University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk)) and [Christopher Yau](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/christoper-yau) ([Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk)/[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk)) with initial set-up funding from [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk).

## Why are you doing this?

Access to advanced Health Data Science training in the UK is patchy. 

There are concentrations of excellence, particularly around Centres for Doctoral Training, where access to training is restricted to individuals based within certain organisations or even departments within these. There are an increasing variety of training programmes offered both through academic institutions and commercial organisations, but awareness of these training opportunities can be limited, potentially costly and quality assurance maybe lacking. 

Training in certain entry-level topics is highly duplicated (e.g. Introduction to Deep Learning) whilst there is little or no training available in other critical specialist subjects (e.g. Healthcare Requirements Engineering). The lack of scale means financial viability is difficult to achieve for training in certain specialisms. 

Furthermore, for those who are thinking about entering health data science from another discipline, where do you start if you already have considerable expertise and experience in relevant areas? Does someone with a PhD in Theoretical Physics, who can do highly advanced mathematics, need to go back to do a Masters degree in Health Data Science? Can a potential employer afford to invest in the time and cost for someone like this to *“learn on the job”*?

The development of the Academy is a response to all these issues. We want to start connecting the dots of excellence across the UK and support the development of future health data scientists by helping navigate the complex training needs required.

## What will we not do?

The Academy will not support entry-level and introductory training and education in data science. This includes but not exclusively:

-	Mathematical foundations (e.g. linear algebra, numerical analysis),
-	Computer science foundations (e.g. principles of algorithms),
-	Learning programming languages and tools (e.g. how to code in Python),
-	Highly specialised training in subject-specific topics (e.g. bioinformatics analysis using PLINK).

Participants in the Academy will be assumed to have prior experience of these concepts gained from previous studies, work experience or learning through other existing providers (e.g. university-run courses, Coursera).

We do not seek to replicate the many existing training offerings in this domain.

## Who are we looking for?

We expect Academy participants will be someone who has:

1.	Graduate-level experience and capability in core areas of mathematics,
2.	Experience of developing software for scientific research purposes,
3.	The ability to learn new programming languages with relatively little direct guidance.

Participants should also be open-minded and show humility in their approach to learning as they may be introduced to novel concepts or alternate paradigms that conflict with their existing knowledge and practice. 

## What will we do?

The Academy will focus on supporting the following activities:

-	the development of new advanced training courses that fill gaps and unmet needs in health data science,
-	the delivery of training courses that enable disciplinary transitions for scientists with advanced quantitative skills,
-	create and curate accredited learning pathways and curricula to help newcomers to navigate the complex training offerings,
-	providing a specialist forum for employers (academic and commercial) to showcase their research and development activities and attract potential employees.

## Questions you may have

### Can I be involved?

Yes, absolutely. If you have ideas in any of our areas of interest, let us know. 

### I have a course/programme that I run very successfully, are you competing with me?

Absolutely not! We would want to work with you to enhance your training offering through the Academy to reach new audiences, grow participation or gain national recognition from your peers for the quality of your work and being the “go to place” to learn about a certain area of health data science.

### How will you pay for this?

We have obtained initial funding of £130,000 from Health Data Research UK to kickstart this initiative. We currently engaging funders about a further 2-3 years of pump-priming funding to continue the set-up. 

The Academy will need to become a financially sustainable activity and we would envision that this would be achieved through a combination of revenue-sharing from course participation fees, Academy membership fees and charity and industry sponsorship. 

We want to evidence that participation in the Academy justifies the financial investment for the positive returns gained. 

The Academy will not be profit-generating and any unanticipated surpluses will be re-invested back into its continued development. 

### Describe some circumstances that would make me want to participate in the Academy?

**Those seeking training**

> “I am a PhD student in applied mathematics in mechanical engineering. I have been working on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which describe the dynamics of fluid flows over complex structures. I have developed numerical analysis software to solve these PDEs using C++ and CUDA GPU programming. I am reaching the end of my PhD but I would like to move into an area where I can make a more obvious and direct contribution to people’s lives. Medicine looks interesting to me, but I don’t know where to start?”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** The Academy offers a course “*From Zero to Health Data Hero: a one-week rapid tour of health data science.*” which provides students like this with a rapid insightful overview of Health Data Science that contains sufficient technical information to excite.

**Those supporting those in need of training**

> “I am a Senior Lecturer working in a Computer Science department. At a recent internal sandpit event, I met an immunologist and we really hit it off. We came up with some great ideas. Fortunately, I had a new PhD student join me in September who was interested in working on these projects so in preparation I sent them off to a course on single cell bioinformatics at a cost of over £1,000. The student enjoyed the course but said they didn’t understand some of the details. They asked me whether ‘generative adversarial learning’ or ‘multimodal variational autoencoders’ are better for handling the different types of data we have on immune cells from my new collaborator. I had no idea. How can I help them?”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** The Senior Lecturer can refer their student to the Academy website. The student can locate the “Computational Biology” learning pathway and identify that University X has a registered Academy course on “multi-modal data integration techniques”. The Academy also recommends some pre-requisite courses: “Advanced Modelling Techniques” and “Choosing the Right Models: Model Criticism and Evaluation”. The first of these sessions has recently run but the material is available online via the HDR UK Futures platform while the others run later in the term.

**Those looking to recruit**

> “The job market is so competitive. I have advertised a postdoc position for a health data scientist three times now but found no suitable applicants that fit the criteria. My Human Resources team have asked me whether I can relax the criteria and expand my search but I cannot recruit someone who doesn’t have experience of public health epidemiology, can I? How will I get them up to speed? I don’t have time to hand-hold them for the next six months.”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** The health data science job market is highly-competitive and recruiters may need to show flexibility around the experience and skill levels of the individuals they recruit. The Academy could provide an option for recruiters to take on talented individuals who need support in the early parts of their employment. The Academy’s “public health data science” learning pathway would point to a variety of foundational training courses in their areas and then to a virtual library of specialist training advanced materials in epidemiological research methods. It would still be up to you to shape the training of your new postdoc but you wouldn’t feel entirely alone.
