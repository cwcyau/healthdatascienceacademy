Title: Introduction to experimental methods for health data scientists

Leader: Max Little

Duration: 5 days

## Description

### Overview 

Data science in health research and practice has substantial potential to improve patient outcomes, through
the use of computational and statistical methods applied to health-related data about patients. Typically,
this kind of health data in modern practice is large scale, high dimensional, and very often obtained from
non-experimental (observational) settings. The sophistication of modern analytical methods means that
often very weak signals can be detected in this large-scale data and exploited to make potentially useful
predictions. However, this very sensitivity is actually a hindrance, and potentially hazardous, unless the
predictions can be interpreted in the real-world context in which the data was collected. This course aims to
provide an introduction to that context, addressing the most important aspects of real-world experiments
and data collection in the health sciences. The course covers the scientific method as applied in the health
sciences, how various types interventional trials attempt to establish cause and effect through targeted
physiological or behavioural interventions, and how more sophisticated randomized controlled trials are
designed and implemented in practice. It also addresses observational studies and explains the limitations
of non-interventional data collection. The course is delivered through a week-long immersion programme of
daily lectures and interactive exercises, delivered by experienced health science researchers and trialists. It
is aimed at graduate-level data scientists.

## Pre-requisites

## Example Timetable

**Block 1: The scientific method in health sciences** 

The theory-prediction-intervention cycle; the hierarchy of medical evidence; analysis and interpretation; experimenter bias; association vs. causation; biological mechanism; measurement under experimental vs. observational conditions; internal vs. external validity; transportability

**Block 2: Experiments in health research** 

Medical: retrospective vs. prospective; interventional vs. observational; case-control vs. cohort; longitudinal vs. cross-sectional; protocol; inclusion/exclusion; recruitment; attrition; compliance and adherence; follow-up. Behavioural: sampling strategies; self-report vs. expert assessment; manual vs. automated coding

**Block 3: Randomized controlled trials** 

Causal interpretation of RCTs: confounding, mediation, latent causes, graphical models; pre-registration; blinding; double-blinding; complex RCTs: wedges, steps, crossover, multi-step, N-of-1, adaptive, Bayesian

**Block 4: Experimental design** 

Protocol design and implementation; comparison under constraints and unit allocation; combinatorial block designs: BIBD, SBIBD, Latin squares, resolvable designs
