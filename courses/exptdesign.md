# HDR003 Real-world experimental methods for health data science

## Basic Information

Code: HDR003

Title: Real-world experimental methods for health data science

Leader: Max Little

Duration: 4 days

## Description

### Overview 

Experimental methods are concerned with the approach to designing an experiment to support or refute a hypothesis. An appropriate experimental design will therefore allow an experiment to be carried out and answer the question of interest. In contrast the data collected but an unsuitable experimental design can confuse analysis and introduce error into results. However, experimental methods can be an alien concept to many 

This course aims to provide a rapid introduction to important experimental methods and its applications in health data science. The delivery will centred on a series of real-world case studies across a range of health areas to provide participants with a breadth of knowledge on how experimental methods are used in practice. Activities will support experimentation with example problems to understand the need for formal experimental design approaches. 

It is suitable for those with (post-)doctoral level in the mathematical or computational sciences. No prior health data science experience is required.

**Block 1: The scientific method in health sciences** 

The theory-prediction-intervention cycle; the hierarchy of medical evidence; analysis and interpretation; experimenter bias; association vs. causation; biological mechanism; measurement under experimental vs. observational conditions; internal vs. external validity; transportability

**Block 2: Experiments in health research** 

Medical: retrospective vs. prospective; interventional vs. observational; case-control vs. cohort; longitudinal vs. cross-sectional; protocol; inclusion/exclusion; recruitment; attrition; compliance and adherence; follow-up. Behavioural: sampling strategies; self-report vs. expert assessment; manual vs. automated coding

**Block 3: Randomized controlled trials** 

Causal interpretation of RCTs: confounding, mediation, latent causes, graphical models; pre-registration; blinding; double-blinding; complex RCTs: wedges, steps, crossover, multi-step, N-of-1, adaptive, Bayesian

**Block 4: Experimental design** 

Protocol design and implementation; comparison under constraints and unit allocation; combinatorial block designs: BIBD, SBIBD, Latin squares, resolvable designs
