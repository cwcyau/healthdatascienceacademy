# Questions you may have

## Can I be involved?

Yes, absolutely. If you have ideas in any of our areas of interest, let us know. 

## I have a course/programme that I run very successfully, are you competing with me?

Absolutely not! We would want to work with you to enhance your training offering through the Academy to reach new audiences, grow participation or gain national recognition from your peers for the quality of your work and being the “go to place” to learn about a certain area of health data science.

## How will you pay for this?

We have obtained initial funding of £130,000 from Health Data Research UK to kickstart this initiative. We currently engaging funders about a further 2-3 years of pump-priming funding to continue the set-up. 

The Academy will need to become a financially sustainable activity and we would envision that this would be achieved through a combination of revenue-sharing from course participation fees, Academy membership fees and charity and industry sponsorship. 

We want to evidence that participation in the Academy justifies the financial investment for the positive returns gained. 

The Academy will not be profit-generating and any unanticipated surpluses will be re-invested back into its continued development. 

## What does an Academy course look like?

There will be no fixed format as certain approaches might be better suitable for particular topics but we expect that Academy courses will generally be lightweight training options. For illustration, this might include:

- Standalone 1-5 day residential training courses,
- 8x 1 hour virtual interactive seminars (over 8 weeks),
- Self-learn virtual course plus 3-4 tutor-led interactive sessions,
- 4x 2 hour guided mentoring sessions (over 1 year). 

## Describe some circumstances that would make me want to participate in the Academy?

**Those seeking training**

> “I am a PhD student in applied mathematics in mechanical engineering. I have been working on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which describe the dynamics of fluid flows over complex structures. I have developed numerical analysis software to solve these PDEs using C++ and CUDA GPU programming. I am reaching the end of my PhD but I would like to move into an area where I can make a more obvious and direct contribution to people’s lives. Medicine looks interesting to me, but I don’t know where to start?”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** The Academy offers a course “*From Zero to Health Data Hero: a one-week rapid tour of health data science.*” which provides students like this with a rapid insightful overview of Health Data Science that contains sufficient technical information to excite.

**Those supporting those in need of training**

> “I am a Senior Lecturer working in a Computer Science department. At a recent internal sandpit event, I met an immunologist and we really hit it off. We came up with some great ideas. Fortunately, I had a new PhD student join me in September who was interested in working on these projects so in preparation I sent them off to a course on single cell bioinformatics at a cost of over £1,000. The student enjoyed the course but said they didn’t understand some of the details. They asked me whether ‘generative adversarial learning’ or ‘multimodal variational autoencoders’ are better for handling the different types of data we have on immune cells from my new collaborator. I had no idea. How can I help them?”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** The Senior Lecturer can refer their student to the Academy website. The student can locate the “Computational Biology” learning pathway and identify that University X has a registered Academy course on “multi-modal data integration techniques”. The Academy also recommends some pre-requisite courses: “Advanced Modelling Techniques” and “Choosing the Right Models: Model Criticism and Evaluation”. The first of these sessions has recently run but the material is available online via the HDR UK Futures platform while the others run later in the term.

**Those looking to recruit**

> “The job market is so competitive. I have advertised a postdoc position for a health data scientist three times now but found no suitable applicants that fit the criteria. My Human Resources team have asked me whether I can relax the criteria and expand my search but I cannot recruit someone who doesn’t have experience of public health epidemiology, can I? How will I get them up to speed? I don’t have time to hand-hold them for the next six months.”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** The health data science job market is highly-competitive and recruiters may need to show flexibility around the experience and skill levels of the individuals they recruit. The Academy could provide an option for recruiters to take on talented individuals who need support in the early parts of their employment. The Academy’s “public health data science” learning pathway would point to a variety of foundational training courses in their areas and then to a virtual library of specialist training advanced materials in epidemiological research methods. It would still be up to you to shape the training of your new postdoc but you wouldn’t feel that you have to do it entirely alone.

**Those returning to work after a career interruption**

> “I am a new mum who has taken quite a bit of time out over the last few years after having two children. I am returning to work full-time in a few months but a bit worried that I am no longer current with my knowledge of health data science. I haven't thought seriously about science in a while. I would like to become re-engaged with the subject in a friendly environment and find out what I have missed.”

**EXAMPLE ACADEMY SOLUTION:** Academy courses which involve discussion-centred or mentoring-based learning might be suitable in this situation. These courses will connect you with others in the country who might share similar circumstances and experiences. 

## Why the University of Birmingham?

There were a number of reasons that Health Data Research UK chose to work with the University of Birmingham to kickstart this initiative:

1. *Geography* Birmingham is centrally located in the UK and well-connected in terms of transport.
2. *Cost* Compared to London, it is significantly cheaper to operate events from Birmingham.
3. *Existing investments* HDR UK has invested in two Research Data Hubs ([INSIGHT](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/health-data-research-hubs/insight/) and [PIONEER](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/health-data-research-hubs/pioneer/)) in Birmingham. The Academy will work with the PIONEER Hub to establish one of its first courses on using real-world hospital data.
4. *Space* [The Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and AI](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/data-science/index.aspx), which is directed by Professor Iain Styles, will host events for the Academy where these cannot be offered by course providers.
5. *Compute* The Tier 2 High-Performance Computing Facility [Baskerville](https://www.baskerville.ac.uk/) is based in Birmingham.

## Can my university be a part of this?

Yes. The Academy is looking to work with further partners across the UK to develop this initiative.

## Are you trying to be all things to all people?

We would like to! But, ultimately the practical limitations of time and resources will require us to focus on specific target areas. These will determine on levels of community engagement and opportunity.
