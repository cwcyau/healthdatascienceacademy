# Courses

We currently have four example courses in development:

**[HDR001 Fairness in healthcare modelling](courses/fairness.md)**

The course will cover the principles of fairness in healthcare modelling and highlight aspects of fairness that Health Data Scientists need to be aware of in their own research including issues around bias, sampling and algorithmic fairness. Training will be centred on discussion of several modern research papers and involve the use of the Nightingale open data platform.

**[HDR002 Structural Causal Models](courses/causal.md)**

Structural causal models (SCMs) provide a probabilistic language for describing directed relationships between random variables. SCMs are widely used in science and engineering to capture causal relationships between quantitative, measured phenomena in the real world. This course will introduce the formalisms underlying SCMS using the [GRAPL library](https://github.com/max-little/GRAPL) which brings together the most important and useful of such algorithms in one convenient software package. The aim of this course is to enable participants to make the leap from understanding the motivations for causal modelling to actually adopting causal reasoning in applications.

**[HDR003 Real-world Experimental Design](courses/exptdesign.md)**

Experimental design is often taught as a theoretical exercise which is divorced from real-world practice and implementation. This course aims to provide participants with real-world knowledge of how theoretical experimental ideas are translated into actual studies. Expert-led case studies will be used to illustrate example problems in the healthcare domain, demonstrating how experimental design principles can be applied and revealing real-world experience of the compromises and constraints that must be recognised and addressed.

**[HDR004 Electronic Health Record Modelling](courses/pioneer.md)**

Patient medical data is rightly highly restricted and access typically requires a significant administrative effort which is impractical for anyone wishing to access it for training. As a result, the Academy have developed this flagship course, delivered in conjunction with the [PIONEER Research Hub](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/health-data-research-hubs/pioneer/) to open up access to real-world NHS secondary care data to participants for training. The course will provide background on the use of electronic health records (EHR) (including how EHRs are stored, processed and analysed) and provide practical rules for health data analysis that will avoid common issues such as bias and non-identifiability.

**[HDR005 Healthcare Engineering Design](courses/engineering_design.md)**

Is the solution AI or something else? How do you know what the solution to a problem is? How do you know you are solving the right problem? Formal engineering design provides frameworks and processes to enable problem identification, specification and solution generation to be done effectively and efficiently. However, outside of Engineering, it is rare for these ideas to be taught in other disciplines leaving those entering the employment market, desperately short of critical skills. This course provides a rapid introduction to engineering design, its applicability to various health-related scenarios, and reveals the "tricks of the trade" from academic- and industry experts.

**[HDR006 Medical Device Regulation](courses/hardian.md)**

A considerable barrier to technology innovation reaching the market is a lack of understanding of the processes and pathways that medical devices must undergo before they are considered suitable for sale and distribution in the UK and elsewhere. This course, co-developed by [Hardian Health], will provide a comprehensive learning programme on the regulatory, economic and evidence issues necessary to bring products to market. Traditionally training in these areas have often been limited or very costly and participation often biased toward some populaiton sub-groups. Our aim is to open up this key skill set for entrepreneurs to a wider audience, through a course delivered via [HDRUK Futures](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/futures/) that combines virtual learning and in-person teaching at a national level.
