# Courses

We currently have four example courses in development:

**[HDR001 Fairness in healthcare modelling](courses/fairness.md)**

The course will cover the principles of fairness in healthcare modelling and highlight aspects of fairness that Health Data Scientists need to be aware of in their own research including issues around bias, sampling and algorithmic fairness. Training will be centred on discussion of several modern research papers and involve the use of the Nightingale open data platform.

**[HDR002 Structural Causal Models](courses/causal.md)**

Structural causal models (SCMs) provide a probabilistic language for describing directed relationships between random variables. SCMs are widely used in science and engineering to capture causal relationships between quantitative, measured phenomena in the real world. This course will introduce the formalisms underlying SCMS using the [GRAPL library](https://github.com/max-little/GRAPL) which brings together the most important and useful of such algorithms in one convenient software package. The aim of this course is to enable participants to make the leap from understanding the motivations for causal modelling to actually adopting causal reasoning in applications.

**[HDR003 Real-world Experimental Design](courses/exptdesign.md)**

Experimental design is often taught as a theoretical exercise which is divorced from real-world practice and implementation. This course aims to provide participants with real-world knowledge of how theoretical experimental ideas are translated into actual studies. Expert-led case studies will be used to illustrate example problems in the healthcare domain, demonstrating how experimental design principles can be applied and revealing real-world experience of the compromises and constraints that must be recognised and addressed.

**[HDR004 Electronic Health Record Modelling](courses/pioneer.md)**

Patient medical data is rightly highly restricted and access typically requires a significant administrative effort which is impractical for anyone wishing to access it for training. As a result, the Academy have developed this flagship course, delivered in conjunction with the [PIONEER Research Hub](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/health-data-research-hubs/pioneer/) to open up access to real-world NHS secondary care data to participants for training. The course will provide background on the use of electronic health records (EHR) (including how EHRs are stored, processed and analysed) and provide practical rules for health data analysis that will avoid common issues such as bias and non-identifiability.
