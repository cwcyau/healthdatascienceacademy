## How it works

### Application Process

1) **Course details** including information of the length of the course, instructors, etc. 
2) The **scientific remit** what is the motivation for the course and why it fills a gap in the health data science landscape,
3) The **teaching methods** that will be employed and why it will be interesting,
4) Your **evaluation approach** that will enable you to improve the course and keep it up-to-date.
5) Your **sustainability plan** and how you will keep the course financially viable.

For *existing* courses, you should supply information about the historical impact of your course and include names of previous course attendees from whom testamonials or reviews can be obtained. 

### Review Process

Each application will be checked for eligibility by Academy staff and then examined by two reviewers. 

Applications will be scored against the following criteria:

1. Relevance to health data science
2. Specifies a credible unmet training need
3. Uses innovative teaching methods
4. Well-formulated evaluation approach
5. Credible sustainability plan
 
Numerical scores will be given for each category (0 - No evidence, 1 - Satisfactory, 2 - Good, 3 - Excellent) and comments provided.  
 
### Academic Board approval

After eligibility and reviews, the applicants will be informed of the outcomes of these by the Academy. The applicants will be invited to respond to comments and scores. The response and reviews will then be considered at the next Academy Academic Board meeting.

The Academic Board will be asked to either:

2. Recommend the application for revision and resubmission.
3. Decline the application.

## What happens next?

Approved applications will receive information from the Academy with further details. Courses will be allowed to advertise their course as part of the Academy for Health Data Science.
